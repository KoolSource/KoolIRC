== README ==

After approximately two months without any development being done on this plugin I have decided to start a fork. 
If the original developer decides to come back I will gladly drop the project and remove it from the Bukkit Dev in favor of the original developer's release.

WHY?

Many people are slightly dissapointed that this great plugin has been thrown by the wayside and not much development has taken place over the past couple of months.
This fork is in response to those dissapointed people who need to have a reliable IRC <-> Minecraft solution. (KoolSource is one of these groups)
